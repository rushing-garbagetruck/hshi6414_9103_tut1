"Quiz 8"

"Part 1"

The art work I chose is the daytime fireworks entitled "WHEN THE SKY BLOOMS WITH SAKURA" by the contemporary artist Cai Guo-Qiang. Fireworks represent the charm of randomness; however, everything is preset carefully. To simulate this artwork by coding, this project might be employing the techniques of random functions and loop functions which are included in the course content from this unit.

"Part 2"
Code link: https://github.com/yangzhi-1/fireworks.git

This is a fireworks simulator.
The code dynamically generates diverse firework displays by creating various shell types with unique properties and effects. Techniques like randomization of colors, sizes, and launch positions, along with the application of different effects and sound, contribute to a realistic and engaging visual experience. Sequences of shells are coordinated to create complex displays, enhancing the simulation's visual appeal and entertainment value.
