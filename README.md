"Quiz 8"

"Part 1"

The art work I chose is the daytime fireworks entitled "WHEN THE SKY BLOOMS WITH SAKURA" by the contemporary artist Cai Guo-Qiang. Fireworks represent the charm of randomness; however, everything is preset carefully. To simulate this artwork by coding, this project might be employing the techniques of random functions and loop functions which are included in the course content from this unit.
